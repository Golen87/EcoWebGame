If a species ends up with new living conditions, an entire chain of species is affected because everyone is dependent on others. What does a food web on the savannah in Africa look like? Which of all the animals actually has the most prey? What if all the lions in the Serengeti were to die out? And how does climate change affect life in the Serengeti? Try to keep the ecosystem in balance!",

    "info_how_2": "Build a smaller food web by connecting different species and getting the energy to flow through the web so all species are doing well. By changing the living conditions for different species, you can see how the rest of the ecosystem is affected. In the large network, you can select different species and see what they eat and who eats them.",
    "info_data_1": "What data is used here?",
    "info_data_2": "This data set describes a food web consisting of plants and mammals in the Serengeti in East Africa. The data was published by researchers in a scientific journal in 2011. The large food web described consists of 161 species (129 plants, 23 herbivores and 9 carnivores) and 592 links between the species that define who eats whom. In addition, the installation allows smaller parts of the food web to simulate how the species' populations change over time if different events occur.\n\nBy defining an ecosystem as a network, we can visualize how the energy flows between different species and through the different parts of the ecosystem and how different species affect each other both directly and indirectly, i.e. in multiple steps.",

    "map_desc": "The Serengeti is a national park located in northern Tanzania in East Africa. The Serengeti became a national park in 1981 and has an area of about 30,000 km\u00b2.\n\nThe Serengeti is known for its large concentration of savannah animals, such as zebras, wildebeests and lions. Researchers have defined a food web consisting of many plants, herbivorous mammals and carnivorous mammals. There are very few such data sets defined and therefore we focus on the Serengeti here.\n\nIt should be remembered, however, that although many of the Serengeti's animals and plants are included in the data set, other types of animals have also been disregarded here, such as birds, reptiles and insects. The Serengeti's food web is thus even more complex!",

The plants form the basis which support the other species with the energy they need for growing and reproducing.\n\nThe species are affecting each other both positively and negatively, and directly and indirectly. Change in abundance in one species leads to changes at the other species' populations. ",
    "challenge_desc_2": "Every year millions of wildebeests, zebras and other herbivores roam the Serengeti searching for food, hunting out grass that is flourishing after the rains. Following in the footsteps of these herbivores come predators such as lions and hyenas. Thus the entire ecosystem is dependent on the health of the plants.\n\nClimate change will affect the ecosystem of the Serengeti by making droughts longer and rains rarer but more intense. Longer droughts cause the grass to wither away, and heavier rain after a long drought depletes the soil of the nutrients needed by the plants.\n\nClimate change is expected to bring a rise in temperature of 2 \u00b0C by 2080, but it could also be as much as 3-6 \u00b0C!\n\nExperiment and see what happens in your food web in the Serengeti when the climate changes.",
