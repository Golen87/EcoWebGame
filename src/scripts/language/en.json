Which of all the animals actually has the most prey? What if all the lions in the Serengeti were to die out? And how does climate change affect life in the Serengeti?

    "info_data_2": "This data set describes a food web consisting of plants and mammals in the Serengeti in East Africa. The data was published by researchers in a scientific journal in 2011. The large food web described consists of 161 species (129 plants, 23 herbivores and 9 carnivores) and 592 links between the species that define who eats whom. In addition, the installation allows smaller parts of the food web to simulate how the species' populations change over time if different events occur.\n\nBy defining an ecosystem as a network, we can visualize how the energy flows between different species and through the different parts of the ecosystem and how different species affect each other both directly and indirectly, i.e. in multiple steps.",

    "serengeti_desc": "The Serengeti is a national park located in northern Tanzania in East Africa. The Serengeti became a national park in 1981 and has an area of about 30,000 km\u00b2.\n\nThe Serengeti is known for its large concentration of savannah animals, such as zebras, wildebeests and lions. Researchers have defined a food web consisting of many plants, herbivorous mammals and carnivorous mammals. There are very few such data sets defined and therefore we focus on the Serengeti here.\n\nIt should be remembered, however, that although many of the Serengeti's animals and plants are included in the data set, other types of animals have also been disregarded here, such as birds, reptiles and insects. The Serengeti's food web is thus even more complex!",

These livestock compete with the herbivores, such as zebra, wildebeest and gazell, in the Serengeti.

Check out what happens in the food web as the populations of these three herbivores increase.",
    "challenge_desc_4": "A barrier that cuts off the migration routes (e.g. a major road that has been built in the area) means that the herbivores, such as wildebeests and zebras, must stay in the same place for a longer period of time.

There are half as many lions today as there were 25 years ago and they have disappeared from 94% of their range.
