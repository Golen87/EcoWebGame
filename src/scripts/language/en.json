    "info_data_2": "This data set describes a food web consisting of plants and mammals in the Serengeti in East Africa. The data was published by researchers in a scientific journal in 2011. The large food web described consists of 161 species (129 plants, 23 herbivores and 9 carnivores) and 592 links between the species that describe who eats whom. In addition, the installation allows smaller parts of the food web to simulate how the species' population changes over time if different events occur.\n\nBy describing an ecosystem as a network, we can visualize how the energy flows between different species and through the different parts of the ecosystem and how different species affect each other both directly and indirectly, ie and several steps.",

    "serengeti_question": "Why Serengeti?",
    "serengeti_desc": "The Serengeti is a national park located in northern Tanzania in eastern Africa. The Serengeti became a national park in 1981 and has an area of about 30,000 km\u00b2. The Serengeti is known for its large concentration of savanna animals, such as zebras, wildebeest and lions. Researchers have described a food web consisting of many plants, herbivorous mammals and carnivorous mammals. There are not many such datasets described and therefore we focus on the Serengeti here. It should be remembered, however, that although many of Serengeti's animals and plants are included in the data set, other types of animals have also been disregarded here, such as birds, reptiles and insects. Serengeti's food web is thus even more complicated!",

    "challenge_desc_1": "Every year, millions of wildebeest, zebras and other herbivores move clockwise around the Serengeti in search of food, hunting for grass that thrives and greens after the rains. In their footsteps also follow the predators, such as lions and wild dogs. Climate change will affect the Serengeti ecosystem by making droughts longer and rains more rare but also heavier. This affects the plant communities, ie all plants on which the animals depend. For example, a longer drought can cause the grass to wither away and heavier rain after drought can deplete the soil of the nutrients that the plants need to thrive. Test what happens to your Serengeti nutrient web if the grasses shrink sharply (their growth decreases).

There are half as many lions today as there were 25 years ago and they have disappeared from 94% of their distribution area.
